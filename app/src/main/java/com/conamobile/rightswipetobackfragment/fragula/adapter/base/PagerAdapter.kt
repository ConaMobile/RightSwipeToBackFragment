/**
 * Base class providing the adapter to populate pages inside of
 * a [ViewPager].  You will most likely want to use a more
 * specific implementation of this, such as
 * [androidx.fragment.app.FragmentPagerAdapter] or
 * [androidx.fragment.app.FragmentStatePagerAdapter].
 *
 *
 * When you implement a PagerAdapter, you must override the following methods
 * at minimum:
 *
 *  * [.instantiateItem]
 *  * [.destroyItem]
 *  * [.getCount]
 *  * [.isViewFromObject]
 *
 *
 *
 * PagerAdapter is more general than the adapters used for
 * [AdapterViews][android.widget.AdapterView]. Instead of providing a
 * View recycling mechanism directly Navigator uses callbacks to indicate the
 * steps taken during an update. A PagerAdapter may implement a form of View
 * recycling if desired or use a more sophisticated method of managing page
 * Views such as Fragment transactions where each page is represented by its
 * own Fragment.
 *
 *
 * Navigator associates each page with a key Object instead of working with
 * Views directly. This key is used to track and uniquely identify a given page
 * independent of its position in the adapter. A call to the PagerAdapter method
 * [.startUpdate] indicates that the contents of the Navigator
 * are about to change. One or more calls to [.instantiateItem]
 * and/or [.destroyItem] will follow, and the end
 * of an update will be signaled by a call to [.finishUpdate].
 * By the time [finishUpdate][.finishUpdate] returns the views
 * associated with the key objects returned by
 * [instantiateItem][.instantiateItem] should be added to
 * the parent ViewGroup passed to these methods and the views associated with
 * the keys passed to [destroyItem][.destroyItem]
 * should be removed. The method [.isViewFromObject] identifies
 * whether a page View is associated with a given key object.
 *
 *
 * A very simple PagerAdapter may choose to use the page Views themselves
 * as key objects, returning them from [.instantiateItem]
 * after creation and adding them to the parent ViewGroup. A matching
 * [.destroyItem] implementation would remove the
 * View from the parent ViewGroup and [.isViewFromObject]
 * could be implemented as `return view == object;`.
 *
 *
 * PagerAdapter supports data set changes. Data set changes must occur on the
 * main thread and must end with a call to [.notifyDataSetChanged] similar
 * to AdapterView adapters derived from [android.widget.BaseAdapter]. A data
 * set change may involve pages being added, removed, or changing position. The
 * Navigator will keep the current page active provided the adapter implements
 * the method [.getItemPosition].
